The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatLayoutModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatLayoutModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/layout';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatLayoutModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatLayoutModule:\nimport { MatLayoutModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/layout';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatLayoutModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}Usage\nPlease see the example of the demo app here https://angular-material-extensions.github.io/layout\n\n\nOther Angular Libraries\n\n@firebaseui/ng-bootstrap\nngx-linkifyjs\n@angular-material-extensions/password-strength\n@angular-material-extensions/password-strength\n@angular-material-extensions/link-preview\n@angular-material-extensions/pages\n@angular-material-extensions/contacts\n@angular-material-extensions/faq\n@angular-material-extensions/combination-generator\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nDrop an email to: Anthony Nahas\nor open an appropriate issue\nlet us chat on Gitter\nBuilt by and for developers :heart: we will help you :punch:\n\n\n\n\nThis project is supported by jetbrains with 1 ALL PRODUCTS PACK OS LICENSE incl. webstorm\n\n\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2018 Anthony Nahas.
